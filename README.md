## Description

The Linux Terminal project is a web application that emulates a Linux terminal environment in the browser. It provides users with a command-line interface to interact with and execute commands, just like a real Linux terminal.

The terminal interface is designed to resemble a classic Linux terminal with a modern twist. It features a sleek design, a customizable background image, and a transparent panel.
